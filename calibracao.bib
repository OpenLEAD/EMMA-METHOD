abstract = {In this work we propose a novel Hough voting approach for the detection of free-form shapes in a 3D space, to be used for object recognition tasks in 3D scenes with a significant degree of occlusion and clutter. The proposed method relies on matching 3D features to accumulate evidence of the presence of the objects being sought in a 3D Hough space. We validate our proposal by presenting a quantitative experimental comparison with state-of-the-art methods as well as by showing how our method enables 3D object recognition from real-time stereo data.},
